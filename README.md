## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/V1997/AI-Research-Content-Assistant.git
cd AI-Research-Content-Assistant
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Your Environment
- **API Key Authentication:**
  - Generate a secret API key (e.g., `my-super-secret-key`).
  - Set it in your Vercel (or local) environment as `ALLOWED_API_KEY`.
- **mcp.json:**
  - Copy and edit the provided `mcp.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "research-content-assistant": {
      "url": "http://localhost:3000/mcp"
    }
  },
  "userCredentials": {
    "notion": {
      "apiKey": "YOUR_NOTION_API_KEY_HERE"
    },
    "googleDrive": {
      "clientId": "YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID_HERE",
      "clientSecret": "YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE",
      "refreshToken": "YOUR_GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN_HERE"
    },
    "github": {
      "token": "YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN_HERE"
    }
  },
  "apiKey": "YOUR_MCP_API_KEY_HERE"
}
```
  - Replace the credential placeholders with your own API keys/tokens.
  - Set `apiKey` to match your `ALLOWED_API_KEY`.

### 4. Start the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
- The server will run at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### 5. Deploying to Vercel
- Push your code to GitHub.
- Import the repo into [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
- Set your environment variables (including `ALLOWED_API_KEY`).
- Deploy!

## Usage with Claude Desktop (or any agent)
- Configure your agent to point to your MCP server endpoint (e.g., `https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app/mcp`).
- Ensure every API request includes the `x-api-key` header with your API key.
- Provide your own credentials in the request body or via `mcp.json` as needed.

---

## Security
- **API Key Authentication:** All requests must include the correct `x-api-key` header.
- **Rate Limiting:** Each IP is limited to 100 requests per minute.
- **CORS:** Only trusted origins are allowed (customize in `route.ts`).
- **Credential Handling:**
  - Credentials are never logged or stored.
  - Used only for the duration of each request.
  - Always use HTTPS in production.
