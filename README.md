# AI Research & Content Generation Assistant

This project is an AI-powered assistant designed to aggregate, synthesize, and deliver research content from multiple sourcesâ€”including Notion, Google Docs, Wikipedia, and Samsung Notes. Built with Next.js and TypeScript, it exposes modular API endpoints for seamless integration with Claude Desktop (MCP) and similar agentic platforms.

---

## Features
- **Modular Integrations:** Easily connect to Notion, Google Docs, Wikipedia, and Samsung Notes.
- **Normalized Content Model:** Unified data structure for all sources.
- **Secure Authentication:** Environment-based credential management.
- **MCP/Claude Desktop Ready:** Exposes endpoints as tools for agentic AI workflows.
- **Extensible Architecture:** Add new integrations with minimal effort.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <project-directory>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```sh
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your credentials:
```
# Notion
NOTION_API_KEY=your_notion_secret

# (Add Google, Samsung, etc. as needed)
```

### 4. Run Locally
```sh
npm run dev
```
The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## API & Tool Endpoints
Endpoints are exposed for each integration and can be used by Claude Desktop or other MCP-compatible agents.

### Example: Notion Fetch Tool
- **Endpoint:** `/api/[transport]` (POST)
- **Input:**
  ```json
  {
    "tool": "Notion Fetch",
    "input": { "pageId": "YOUR_PAGE_ID" }
  }
  ```
- **Output:**
  ```json
  {
    "content": [
      { "type": "text", "text": "Page Title" },
      { "type": "text", "text": "Page body content..." }
    ]
  }
  ```

---

## Integrations
- **Notion:** Fetches and normalizes page content. Requires sharing the page with your Notion integration and providing the API key.
- **Google Docs, Wikipedia, Samsung Notes:** Modular endpoints to be added following the same pattern.

---

## Security
- All credentials are managed via environment variables and excluded from version control via `.gitignore`.
- Never commit sensitive information to the repository.

---

## Deployment
- Deploy to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) or your preferred platform.
- Set environment variables in your deployment dashboard.
