# AI Research & Content Assistant – Integration Action Plan

## Objective
Integrate external tools (Notion, Google Drive/Docs) and a company research/resume tailoring module as modular, secure, and robust endpoints for AI-powered research, content generation, and career alignment.

## Action Plan

### 1. Project Structure & Setup
- [ ] Create an `integrations/` directory for external tool modules
- [ ] Define a common data model for normalized content output

### 2. Notion Integration
- [ ] Set up Notion API credentials (OAuth or integration token)
- [ ] Implement `notion.ts` module:
    - [ ] Authentication logic
    - [ ] Fetch/read content by page/database ID
    - [ ] Normalize data to common format
- [ ] Expose Notion tool in `route.ts`

### 3. Google Drive/Docs Integration
- [ ] Set up Google API credentials (OAuth)
- [ ] Implement `googdrive.ts` module:
    - [ ] Authentication logic
    - [ ] Fetch/read document content by Doc ID
    - [ ] Normalize data to common format
- [ ] Expose Google Drive/Docs tool in `route.ts`

### 4. Company Research & Resume Tailoring Integration
- [ ] Design a module to:
    - [ ] Extract a company’s core values and tone (from public sources, company website, etc.)
    - [ ] Gather user achievements from GitHub
    - [ ] Ingest and parse 3–4 versions of the user’s resume
    - [ ] Generate questions to explore how the user’s experience reflects company values
    - [ ] Tailor the resume to a specific job description (provided via Claude Desktop AI chat)
    - [ ] Adjust resume language, achievements, and GitHub project highlights to align with company culture and job requirements
    - [ ] Ensure edits are made within the user’s existing resume format
- [ ] Expose this as a tool in `route.ts` for use by the AI agent

### 5. Endpoint & Tool Exposure
- [ ] Import all integration modules in `route.ts`
- [ ] Define a tool for each integration using the handler (e.g., `createMcpHandler`)
- [ ] Validate input and handle errors for each tool

### 6. Security & Environment
- [ ] Store API keys and secrets securely (env vars)
- [ ] Implement token refresh logic for OAuth integrations

### 7. Testing & Validation
- [ ] Test each integration module independently
- [ ] Test tool endpoints via API (Postman/curl)
- [ ] Validate integration with Claude Desktop/MCP agent

### 8. Documentation
- [ ] Document each tool’s input/output and authentication requirements
- [ ] Update README with integration and usage instructions

**Note:** Backend orchestration/aggregation is not required; focus on robust, stateless tool endpoints. AI agent will handle tool chaining and synthesis.
